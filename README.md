# Code Refactor

This project was an exercise in updating non-semantic HTML to semantic HTML by going through the code line by line and correcting as appropriate without changing the structure or look of the original design. This is to make the website more accessible to more people and devices, and optimize search engine results. This way, more people of all kinds can interact with the website.
